# mdBook

**mdBook** is a command-line tool and Rust crate to create books using Markdown
(as by the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) specification) files. It's very
similar to GitBook but written in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org).

What you are reading serves as an example of mdBook's output, and at the
same time as high-level documentation.

mdBook is free and open source; the source code is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). You can post issues and feature
requests can on the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues).

## API docs

You can also read the [API
docs](https://docs.rs/mdbook/*/mdbook/) generated by Rustdoc if you would like
to use mdBook as a crate to, for examle, write a new renderer.
